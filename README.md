# Calculator
Day 1 of 100 Days of Code challenge. A Basic Calculator created on WPF. Created on 16/09/2021.

# Features
1. Can do basic two number calculations using the basic arithmetic operators. (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division)
2. Standard Calculator layout.
3. Clear button clears the whole display.

# Things Learnt
1. With the <Style.Triggers> tag I was able to have more control over the button triggers, such as a mouse hover. I applied this knowledge so when the user hovers over a button, the background colour would change. (I did not like the default background colour becuase it felt out of place compared to the overall aesthetic of the program.)
2. Using the <Setter> tag also allowed me to predefine a set of custom commands for a specific element. I used this to apply a consistant style to the program's buttons. I realise that doing this removed the need for code reppetition. 
  
# Future Features
1. Error handling. i.e. When a user inputs รท0, an error should be outputted.
2. BIDMAS. e.g. When a user inputs 1+2x3
3. Adding a Delete Button to remove the character on the end of the calculation.
